The child actor began getting parts on series television in 1967.\n\nHer place in TV history was cemented when she landed the role of Jan Brady, the middle of three daughters in a mixed family that also featured three sons, in the TV sitcom \"The Brady Bunch\". The show, which debuted in 1969, ran for five seasons, through 1974 and spawned numerous spin-offs. While Plumb declined to reprise the role of Jan in the first spin-off, the TV variety show\u00a0The Brady Bunch Variety Hour (1976-1977) as she did not want to sign a five-year contract (the show was canceled after nine episodes), she did appear as Jan in the subsequent spin-offs featuring the original cast: the TV movie\u00a0The Brady Girls Get Married\u00a0(1981) (1981), the short-lived sitcom The Brady Brides (1981), the TV movie\u00a0A Very Brady Christmas\u00a0(1988), and another short-lived TV series,\u00a0The Bradys\u00a0(1990).  Though she has worked steadily in TV since a child, her only other major role was as a teenage hooker in the 1976 TV movie\u00a0Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway. In the 1990s, Plumb began painting, fashioning for herself a second artistic career. She works out of a studio at her Laguna Beach home. - IMDb Mini Biography",

During the early 90s she performed as part of the duo Golden Carillo with Frank Carillo. They released 3 albums, Fire in Newtown, Toxic Emotion, and Back for More. She then returned to The Shirts. Since then she has performed solo and with a band. She performs a revue of songs from her stage career along with originals called Annie Golden's Velvet Prison.\n\nWhile with The Shirts she was discovered by Milo\u0161 Forman who gave her a part in Hair. She has had featured roles on Cheers and Miami Vice. On Broadway, she has appeared in the 1977 revival of Hair, Leader of the Pack, Ah, Wilderness!, On the Town, and The Full Monty as well as the title role in the workshop of the short lived adaptation of Stephen King's novel, Carrie. She also played the role of Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme in Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman's musical Assassins in 1991. In 2007, she was hired as stand-by actress for the two comic villain roles in Broadway's Xanadu musical. Annie Golden was also the voice of Marina in the Don Bluth film The Pebble and the Penguin.\n\nGolden has the distinct honor of having appeared in three separate versions of Hair: a Broadway revival in 1977, the motion picture in 1979 and a special benefit performance concert in 2004. In recent years, she has been seen in commercials for Coinstar, in which she portrays The Tooth Fairy.

She attended Georgetown Day School. Her entry into the performing arts was at age 3 when she began studying tap dance, ballet, jazz dance and modern dance. She made her stage debut in To Kill a Mockingbird when she was 9 years old, and soon after she became a regular on her local stage. At 14, however, acting took a backseat to modeling after Sagemiller was scouted by Eileen Ford in a jewelry shop. She eventually left modeling to take an undergraduate degree in Art History at the University of Virginia.\n\nShortly after graduation, she decided to return to acting full-time, and studied at the Stella Adler Conservatory, New York University's Stonestreet Studio and at Michael Howard Studios. Sagemiller appeared in Movieline magazine in August 2001. In November 2001, Sagemiller appeared in Gear magazine. In early career, she starred on number of teen films, like Get Over It and Sorority Boys, and was lead actress in 2002 box office bomb thriller Soul Survivors.\n\nOn television, Sagemiller portrayed the character Michelle Ernhardt in the TNT series Raising the Bar from 2008 to 2009. After that series was cancelled, Sagemiller joined Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in a recurring role as ADA Gillian Hardwicke. She replaced Paula Patton when Patton departed the series after just one episode. Sagemiller was featured in ten episodes of the 12th season of SVU. She was replaced in the 13th season by Stephanie March and Diane Neal. In 2013, she was cast as female lead on Chicago Fire spinoff Chicago PD,but later left from show.",

She is of English and Czech descent and began performing musicals and plays at local theaters, and studied at the University of Pennsylvania, where she graduated with a B.A. in European History. At Penn, Newton was a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority.\n\nAfter graduation, Newton then moved to New York City and landed several roles in television commercials for such companies as the Olive Garden.\n\nNewton portrayed the character Amanda Tanen in the comedy-drama series Ugly Betty from 2006 to 2010. With co-star Michael Urie, Newton co-hosted the Official Ugly Betty Podcast. She also appeared in ABC.com's Mode After Hours webisode series. Ugly Betty was canceled in 2010 after four successful seasons allowing the show to receive a proper series finale.\n\nIn late 2009, Newton performed at a New York City Center Encores! presentation of the Gershwin musical Girl Crazy, which was directed by Jerry Zaks. She portrayed Molly Gray and performed opposite real-life husband Chris Diamantopoulos.\n\nNewton starred in the television series Love Bites.

NBC announced the pick up of the series in May 2010.However, with Newton announcing her pregnancy, co-star Jordana Spiro contractually obligated to stay with her other show My Boys (which was later cancelled) and Chupack's desire to leave the show, Love Bites was pushed back to midseason. Love Bites aired in summer 2011 on NBC and was cancelled after eight episodes. In November 2011, Newton was cast on CBS's How I Met Your Mother as Quinn, a love interest for Neil Patrick Harris's character Barney Stinson. She currently stars in the Fox mid-season TV series The Goodwin Games.\n\nNewton met her husband, Chris Diamantopoulos, in a subway station in New York, and they married on 12 May 2005.

The epitome of the word \"statuesque,\" brunette, big blue-eyed, and 6' tall Lynda Carter was once considered one of the most beautiful women in the western world. Born and raised in Phoenix, AZ, Carter's height caused considerable awkwardness in high school. Friends encouraged her to become a performer; she began studying voice and by the time she graduated, she was named her school's most talented student. She briefly attended Arizona State University, but dropped out to become a professional singer and tour the country with several rock groups. By 1972, Carter had returned home and entered a local beauty pageant. She won and went on to win the title of Miss World-USA. After that, Carter studied acting in New York. She started her career in television making guest appearances on such shows as Starsky and Hutch, but Carter did not become famous until winning the title role of Wonder Woman in 1975. The Wonder Woman shows originally started out as specials on the ABC network, but by 1976 had been turned into a series. The network canceled the show after one season and it was picked up by CBS and aired there for a few years. When the series ended, she had a somewhat successful career as a Las Vegas entertainer. She also continues to occasionally appear in television movies and as a series guest star. ~ Sandra Brennan, Rovi",

Blethyn has received two Academy Award nominations, two SAG Award nominations, two Emmy Award nominations and three Golden Globe Award nominations, winning one. In addition, she has won a BAFTA, an Empire Award and a Golden Lion, and has earned a Theater World Award and both a Critics' Circle Theatre Award and a Laurence Olivier Award nomination for her theatrical work.\n\nBorn into a working class home in Ramsgate, Kent, Blethyn pursued an administrative career until her early 30s before enrolling in the Guildford School of Acting after the dissolution of her marriage in 1973. She subsequently joined the Royal National Theatre and received credits for her performances in Troilus and Cressida (1976) and Mysteries (1979). In 1981, Blethyn earned her first critical acclaim for Steaming.\n\nIn 1980, Blethyn made her television debut in Mike Leigh's film Grown-Ups; then, after a modest number of guest spots in several productions, in the mid-1980s she garnered leading roles in the short-living sitcoms Chance in a Million and The Labours of Erica. Having followed her big screen debut with smaller supporting roles in films such as The Witches (1990) and A River Runs Through It (1992), she made her real cinema breakthrough with her role in the 1996 dramedy Secrets &amp; Lies, for which she received rave reviews.\n\nBlethyn has since appeared in an eclectic range of films, including independent comedies such as Saving Grace (2000), Plots with a View (2002) and Clubland (2007), music-themed films like Little Voice (1998) and Beyond the Sea (2004) and big-budget dramas such as Pride &amp; Prejudice (2005) and Atonement (2007). In addition, Blethyn has appeared in television productions including The Buddha of Suburbia (1993), Anne Frank: The Whole Story (2001), Belonging (2004) and War and Peace (2007).

Although ABC and Warner Bros. officials told the magazine she was only cast as a guest star, the announcement led to speculation and concern that Mitchell's character would be killed off at the end of Lost's fifth season, which ended on a cliffhanger that left the fate of her character unknown. Mitchell was later named the lead actress on V in an ABC press release and various sources reported that she would guest-star in Lost's sixth, final season.Mitchell's character was killed off in the sixth season premiere, but returned for the two-part series finale for which she received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.\n\nThe show V was picked up for a second season, which premiered on January 4, 2011 but was not picked up for a third season.

The series premiered on September 17, 2012.\n\nActress Elizabeth Banks who was born Elizabeth Irene Mitchell, changed her name to avoid confusion with Mitchell.\n\nMitchell married actor Chris Soldevilla in 2004 with whom she has a son named C.J., who was born in 2005.\n\nIn 2013 Mitchell and Soldevilla divorced due to irreconcilable differences.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Elizabeth Mitchell , licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In the 1986 war film, Salvador, directed by Oliver Stone and starring James Woods, she portrayed an American nun in El Salvador who was raped and murdered.\n\nGibb's best known TV role was on the soap opera Search for Tomorrow as Susan \"Suzi\" Martin Wyatt Carter from 1981-1983. She was also a regular for three seasons on the original Fame TV show and appeared in the first three Diagnosis: Murder movies in 1992 as Dr. Amanda Bentley.\n\nIn the TV adaptation of Gypsy she starred as the adult Rose Louise/Gypsy Rose Lee, opposite Bette Midler as Mama Rose. She later starred in the 1995 short lived TV series Deadly Games. She has also played in many TV movies, including the role of Karen Carpenter in The Karen Carpenter Story (1989).\n\nShe has three children\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Cynthia Gibb, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia",

  "biography": "\"Loverly\" soprano Marni Nixon has ensured herself a proper place in film history although most moviegoers would not recognize her if they passed her on the street. But if you heard her, that might be a horse of a different color. Marni is one of those unsung heroes (or should I say \"much sung\" heroes) whose incredible talents were given short shrift at the time. For those who think film superstars such as Deborah Kerr, Natalie Wood, and Audrey Hepburn possessed not only powerhouse dramatic talents but amazing singing voices as well...think again. Kerr's Anna in The King and I (1956), Natalie's Maria in West Side Story (1961), and Audrey's Eliza in My Fair Lady (1964) were all dubbed by the amazing Marni Nixon, and nowhere in the credits will you find that fact. Born Marni McEathron in Altadena, California, she was a former child actress and soloist with the Roger Wagner Chorale in the beginning. Trained in opera, yet possessing a versatile voice for pop music and easy standards as well, she not only sang for Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg and Igor Stravinsky but also recorded light songs. Marni made her Broadway musical debut in 1954 in a show that lasted two months but nothing came from it. In 1955, the singer contracted to dub Deborah Kerr in The King and I (1956) was killed in a car accident in Europe and a replacement was needed. Marni was hired...and the rest is history. Much impressed, the studios brought her in to \"ghost\" Ms. Kerr's voice once again in the classic tearjerker An Affair to Remember (1957). From there she went on to make Natalie Wood and Audrey Hepburn sound incredibly good with such classic songs as \"Tonight\" and \"Wouldn't It Be Loverly.\"\n\nShe finally appeared on screen in a musical in The Sound of Music (1965) starring Julie Andrews, who physically resembles Marni. The role is a small one, however, and she is only given a couple of solo lines in \"How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?\" as a singing nun. Marni's vocal career in films dissolved by the mid 1960s, but she continued on with concerts and in symphony halls, while billing herself as \"The Voice of Hollywood\" in one-woman cabaret shows. Throughout the years, she has played on the legit stage, including the lead roles in \"The King and I\" and \"The Sound of Music,\" and in her matronly years has been seen as Fraulein Schneider in \"Cabaret,\" and in the musicals \"Follies\" and \"70 Girls 70.\" Her last filmed singing voice was as the grandmother in the animated feature Mulan (1998) in the 1990s. Married three times, twice to musicians; one of her husbands, Ernest Gold, by whom she had three children, was a film composer and is best known for his Academy Award-winning epic Exodus (1960).\n\nMarni Nixon died  July 24, 2016 (age 86), in New York City, New York, USA",

  "biography": "\u200bDebra Lynn Messing (born August 15, 1968) \u00a0best known for her role as Grace Adler in the sitcom Will &amp; Grace.\n\nMessing was born in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, the daughter of Sandra (n\u00e9e Simons), who has worked as a professional singer, banker, travel and real estate agent, and Brian Messing, a sales executive for a costume jewelry packaging manufacturer. Messing is Jewish, a descendant of immigrants from Russia and Poland. When Messing was three, she moved with her parents and her older brother, Brett, to East Greenwich, a small town outside Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nDuring her high school years, she acted and sang in a number of high school productions at East Greenwich High School, including the starring roles in the musicals Annie and Grease. She took lessons in dance, singing, and acting. In 1986, she was Rhode Island's Junior Miss and competed in Mobile, Alabama in the America's Junior Miss scholarship program. While her parents encouraged her dream of becoming an actress, they also urged her to complete a liberal arts education before deciding on acting as a career. Following their advice, she attended Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. During her junior year, she studied theater at the prestigious London-based British European Studio Group program, an experience that solidified her desire to act.\n\nIn 1990, after graduating summa cum laude from Brandeis University with a bachelor's degree in theater arts, Messing gained admission to the elite Graduate Acting Program at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts which accepts approximately fifteen new students annually. She earned a Master's Degree in Fine Arts after three years.\n\nIn 1993, Messing won praise for her acting in the pre-Broadway workshop production of Tony Kushner's play Angels in America: Perestroika. Subsequently, she appeared in several episodes of the television series NYPD Blue during 1994 and 1995.\n\nIn 1995, Messing made her film debut in Alfonso Arau's A Walk in the Clouds playing the unfaithful wife of main character Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves). This exposure led the Fox network to make her the co-star of the television sitcom, Ned &amp; Stacey. The series lasted for two seasons, from 1995 to 1997. Messing appeared as Jerry Seinfeld's date in two episodes of the series Seinfeld: \"The Wait Out\" in 1996 and \"The Yada Yada\" in 1997. Messing turned down a starring role in another television sitcom to appear in Donald Margulies's two-character play Collected Stories, which opened at the Off-Broadway Manhattan Theater Club. She also co-starred in the Tom Arnold vehicle McHale's Navy in 1997.\n\nIn 1998, Messing played a lead role as the bio-anthropologist Sloan Parker on ABC's dramatic science fiction television series Prey. During this time her agent approached her with the pilot script for the television show Will &amp; Grace. Messing was inclined to take some time off, but the script intrigued her, and she auditioned for the role of Grace Adler, beating out Nicollette Sheridan, who later guest-starred on the show as a romantic rival of Grace's. Will &amp; Grace became a ratings success, and Messing became a star.\n\nIn 2002, she was named one of the \"50 Most Beautiful People in the World\" by People Magazine. TV Guide picked her as its \"Best Dressed Woman\" in 2003. Messing was cast by director Woody Allen in a small role in his 2002 film Hollywood Ending. Her film roles since include a happily married but ill-fated wife in the supernatural thriller The Mothman Prophecies (2002) and a supporting role in Along Came Polly (2004). The Wedding Date (2005) was Messing's first leading role in a high-profile film. It received mixed reviews but performed fairly well at the box office. Messing was featured as a judge on the season finale of the second season of Bravo's reality show, Project Runway. She also starred in the television mini-series The Starter Wife, which was nominated for ten Emmy awards including one for Messing for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie.\n\nIn 2008, Messing reprised her role as Molly Kagan in the television series The Starter Wife, which included 10 episodes. In early 2010, Messing will star in the new ABC comedy series Wright vs. Wrong for the 2010-2011 primetime season.",
