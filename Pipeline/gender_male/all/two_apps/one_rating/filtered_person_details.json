But we showed how that technology, if used correctly, could become a powerful learning tool...I see the same kind of opportunity emerging today as parents and educators increasingly view iPods with skepticism.

In 2004, he was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. presidential election. He hosts his own radio talk show, Keepin' It Real, and he makes regular guest appearances cable news television. In 2011, he was named the host of MSNBC's PoliticsNation, a nightly talk show. In 2015, the program was shifted to Sunday mornings.\n\nSharpton's supporters praise \"his ability and willingness to defy the power structure that is seen as the cause of their suffering\" and consider him \"a man who is willing to tell it like it is\". Former Mayor of New York City Ed Koch, a one-time foe, said that Sharpton deserves the respect he enjoys among black Americans: \"He is willing to go to jail for them, and he is there when they need him.\" President Barack Obama said that Sharpton is \"the voice of the voiceless and a champion for the downtrodden.\" A 2013 Zogby Analytics poll found that one quarter of African Americans said that Sharpton speaks for them.\n\nHis critics describe him as \"a political radical who is to blame, in part, for the deterioration of race relations\". Sociologist Orlando Patterson has referred to him as a racial arsonist, while liberal columnist Derrick Z. Jackson has called him the black equivalent of Richard Nixon and Pat Buchanan. Sharpton sees much of the criticism as a sign of his effectiveness. \"In many ways, what they consider criticism is complimenting my job,\" he said. \"An activist's job is to make public civil rights issues until there can be a climate for change.\"\n\n(Wikipedia)",

He has one brother, Silvestre, with whom he starred in Raising Victor Vargas. Rasuk attended performing arts school as a teenager, and began acting at 14. He garnered his first movie role at 16 in Five Feet High and Rising. The film\u2014less than 30 minutes long\u2014was a hit at the Independent Spirit Film Festival. Two years later, the same director, Peter Sollett, suggested expanding the short film into a feature-length movie: Raising Victor Vargas, which went on to win Rasuk an Independent Spirit Award for his work. In his next film, Rock Steady, Rasuk played a character named Roc. Two years later, he took a leading role in Haven with Orlando Bloom. In 2005, Lords of Dogtown was released, with Victor playing Tony Alva, one of the leading roles. The part included surfing and performing skateboarding tricks. Although the more complicated maneuvers were performed by stunt men (including the scenes of surfing at Pacific Ocean Park pier and skating in empty swimming pools), Rasuk is a method actor and worked on remaining in character both on and off screen. Believing he had mastered skating a huge ramp in only his second week of training, Rasuk fractured one of his orbital bones. Rasuk says the accident likely earned him more respect from serious skaters within the cast and crew. Victor can now be seen on the HBO television series How To Make It In America (2010), co-starring alongside Bryan Greenberg and rapper Kid Cudi. Marjorie Ballentine is his acting coach.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article\u00a0Victor Rasuk\u00a0, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

  "biography": "At one time in the early 1970s, it seemed like George Segal would have a career like that enjoyed by his contemporary Jack Nicholson, that of an actor's actor equally adept at comedy and drama. Segal never made the leap to superstar status, and surprisingly, has never won a major acting award, the latter phenomenon being particularly surprising when viewed from the period 1973-4, when he reached the height of his career, appearing in A Touch of Class (1973) and Robert Altman's California Split (1974). It was at this point that Segal's career went awry, when he priced himself as a superstar with a seven-figure salary, but failed to come through at the box office. For example, The Black Bird (1975) was a failure, but, ironically, at the end of the decade, he dropped out of a movie that would have burnished his tarnished lustre as a star: Blake Edwards' 10 (1979). 10 (1979) made Dudley Moore a star, while Arthur (1981) made him a superstar in the 1980s, a lost decade for Segal. It was an example of a career burnout usually associated with the \"Oscar curse\" (his No Way to Treat a Lady (1968) co-star Rod Steiger, for example, was a great character actor whose career was run off the rails by the expectations raised by the Academy Award). George Segal has never won an Oscar, but more surprisingly, has only been nominated once, for Best Supporting Actor of 1966 for his role as \"Nick\" in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966). George Segal was born on February 13, 1934 in Great Neck, Long Island, New York. After a stint in the military, he made his bones as a stage actor before being cast in his first meaty film role in The Young Doctors (1961). His turns in Ship of Fools (1965) and the eponymous King Rat (1965) in 1965 heralded the arrival of a major talent. He followed it up with his Oscar-nominated performance in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), in which he more than held his own against Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) was a cultural phenomenon, the film that wrecked the MPDDA censorship code that had been in place since 1934, and a huge box office success to boot. He had arrived in the major leagues.  By the early 1970s, appearances in such films as The Owl and the Pussycat (1970), Blume in Love (1973), Born to Win (1971) and The Hot Rock (1972) had made him a major star with an enviable reputation, just under the heights of the superstar status enjoyed by the likes of Paul Newman. He followed up A Touch of Class (1973) (a hit film for which his co-star Glenda Jackson won an Oscar) and his brilliant performance as the out-of-control gambler in California Split (1974) with a co-starring turn opposite of Jane Fonda in Fun with Dick and Jane (1977), a big hit that revitalized Jane Fonda's film carer. He gave a deft comic performance in Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe? (1978) with Jacqueline Bisset and Robert Morley, which proved a modest box office success. For all practical purposes, even after the failures of The Black Bird (1975), \"Lucky Lady\" and The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox (1976), it seemed like Segal, with a few deft career choices, could reorient his career and deliver on the promise of his early period.  That he didn't may be the unintended consequence of his focusing on comedy to the detriment of drama. The comedy A Touch of Class (1973) made him a million dollar-per-film movie star, and that's what he concentrated on. Segal began relying on his considerable charm to pull off movies that had little going for them other than their star, and it backfired on him. These films weren't infused with the outrageously funny, subversive comedy of Where's Poppa? (1970), a success from his first period that he enjoyed along with co-star Ruth Gordon and director Carl Reiner.  When Segal first made it in the mid-1960s, he established his serious actor bona fides with a deal he cut with ABC-TV that featured him in TV adaptations of Broadway plays. He also played a very memorable \"Biff Loman\" in Death of a Salesman (1966) (TV), shining in performance in counterpoint to the vital presence that was Lee J. Cobb's \"Willy Loman\". It was a good life for an actor, and he took time to show off his banjo-playing skills by fronting the \"Beverly Hills Unlisted Jazz Band\", with which he cut several records.  While the 1980s were mostly a career wasteland for Segal, he came back in the 1990s, using his flair for comedy as part of the ensemble cast of \"Just Shoot Me!\" (1997).",

As approachable as he is edgy, JIm is responsible for some of the funniest and most memorable moment in recent television (primetime,\u2028cable and late-night circuit and film. \u2028\u2028As a stand-up comedian, Gaffigan\u2019s clever, quiet style has earned him an unprecedented number of appearances on both CBS\u2019 LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN\u2028and NBC\u2019s LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN. \u00a0His recent one hour Comedy Central Special, CD and DVD, all entitled \u201cBeyond the Pale\u201d have catapulted\u2028Gaffigan to one of the most popular touring and recorded comedians in the country today. \u00a0The DVD for \u201cBeyond the Pale\u201d went Gold within the first six months. After Gaffigan\u2019s first appearance on DAVID LETTERMAN, the host personally chose him to develop a sitcom for World Wide Pants. \u00a0Eighteen months later, WELCOME\u2028TO NEW YORK debuted on CBS to critical acclaim. \u00a0He then co-starred with Ellen DeGeneres on her CBS sitcom THE ELLEN SHOW. \u00a0For two years he had\u2028recurring roles both on FOX\u2019s THAT 70'S SHOW and NBC\u2019s ED. \u00a0Jim has also had roles on SEX AND THE CITY, THIRD WATCH and each of the LAW &amp; ORDER\u2028shows, among others. Jim can be seen this November in MY BOYS, TBS' first original scripted comedy series. On film, Jim has endeared himself to audiences by taking on vivid supporting characters in a number of genres. \u00a0In the cult hit SUPER TROOPERS, Gaffigan got huge laughs and famously helped add \"meow\" to the lexicon of Vermont state troopers. \u00a0Jim's quiet dramatic turn in THE GREAT NEW WONDERFUL, a\u2028meditation on the aftermath of 9/11, took audiences and critics by surprise as he embodied an office worker broken by tragedy who ultimately explodes in rage. Gaffigan\u2019s other recent film credits include the forthcoming independent films THE LIVING WAKE and STEPHANIE DALEY. \u00a0He has also been featured in TRUST THE MAN, 13 GOING ON 30, THREE KINGS, FINAL, IGBY GOES DOWN, ENTROPY and THIRTY YEARS TO\u2028LIFE. \u00a0In 2004, he co-starred in TNT\u2019s BAD APPLE, with Chris Noth. Gaffigan recently signed on to co-write and lend his voice to 20 new episodes\u2028of PALE FORCE, a series of animated shorts that will air regularly on CONAN and on the internet via webisodes starting in October. \u00a0The series focuses on\u2028two pale crime-fighting superheroes that, like Gaffigan and O'Brien, are equipped with fair skin. Many recognize Gaffigan from his numerous award-winning commercial campaigns, which include Sierra Mist, ESPN, Saturn and Rolling Rock. \u00a0His commercial\u2028presence earned him Business Week\u2019s 1999 \"Salesman of the Year\"honor. Gaffigan currently lives in New York with his family.",

Following some time in college, he enlisted in the United States Army and served overseas as an infantryman.  Returning to the States, Calderon set his sights on an acting career. Starting out on the New York stage, he won an Obie Award for his performance in Blade to the Heat at the Public Theatre. His most notable Broadway role was opposite Robert De Niro in Cuba and His Teddy Bear. Calderon also appeared off-Broadway in such plays as Requiem For A Heavyweight and Divine Horsemen, and played Achilles in the New York Shakespeare Festival\u2019s production of Troilus and Cressida in Central Park. He is a founding member of the Touchstone Theatre, the American Folk Theatre and the Labyrinth Theatre Company.\n\nCalderon was originally slated to portray the role of Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction; Samuel L. Jackson was subsequently given the role.\n\nCorrection Samuel Jackson told Tarantino he had messed up by not casting him in Reservoir Dogs. Tarantino agreed and told him he was writing a script and had a character that he had written specifically with Jackson in mind. Calderon had a better initial reading than Jackson and Tarantino gave serious consideration to casting him as Jules Winnfield.\n\nCalderon portrays Paul the bartender in dialogue scene between Butch Coolidge and Marsellus Wallace.\n\nCalderon also co-wrote Abel Ferrara's 1992 crime drama Bad Lieutenant, starring Harvey Keitel.\n\nCalderon acted in The Last Castle and the critically acclaimed independent feature Girlfight. His more than three dozen film credits also include Out of Sight, Cop Land, Four Rooms, Pulp Fiction, Bad Lieutenant, The Firm, The Addiction, Q &amp; A, Sea of Love, Clockers and King of New York. In addition, he has made numerous guest appearances on television series, including recurring roles on Dream Street, Law &amp; Order and Miami Vice.\n\nIn 2010, Calderon is set to star as The Businessman in Sanzhar Sultanov's crime drama - The Story.",

With work limited in New Zealand, Dale moved to Australia, where he played Dr. John Forrest in The Young Doctors from 1979 to 1982. He later appeared as Jim Robinson in Neighbours, a part he played for eight years. The character is the role Dale is most associated with in Australia and the United Kingdom. He left the series when he fell out with the producers over the pay he and the rest of the cast received.\n\nAfter leaving Neighbours, Dale became typecast as Robinson in Australia and struggled to find work. His career was revitalised after he relocated to the United States in 2000. Since then he has had roles in many American series including prominent parts in The O.C. (as Caleb Nichol) and Ugly Betty (as Bradford Meade), as well as recurring and guest roles in Lost, 24, NCIS, ER, The West Wing, The X-Files and The Lone Gunmen. Dale has also appeared in minor roles in films such as Star Trek Nemesis, Hollywood Homicide and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as well as the London West End production of Spamalot.

He was so nervous he flubbed his two lines. Fortunately, his misread got laughs from Julia Roberts , Richard Donner and the entire crew, and was included in the final cut, giving him some much-needed attention.\n\nAfter other small roles, he had his breakout role as the Freddie Sacker on Darren Star 's Wall Street series The $treet (2000) which allowed him to quit his job waiting tables and move back to New York. He has had several memorable roles on series like Terry Loomis on the critically acclaimed Steven Bochco law drama Philly (2001) . These roles caught Variety magazine's attention who elected Rick one of Variety's 10 Actors to Watch. Then came the role of Jerry Best on The Bernie Mac Show (2001), and Patrick Van Dorn on the John Stamos comedy series Jake in Progress (2005).\n\nHe has had many supporting appearances in movies including The Day After Tomorrow (2004), Blood Work (2002), Hostel (2005), Cellular (2004), and Lions Gate Films The Condemned (2007).

Classical training ensued.\n\nWhile at U of A, he was hired  by Leonard Katzman to play a Comanchero in an episode of \"Gunsmoke\"  being shot at Old Tucson. The SAG card from that made him eligible to  audition for Lee Phillips, who cast him as The Lieutenant in the film  for television of \"The Red Badge of Courage\" with Richard Thomas as The  Youth. That was followed by several guest star roles on the series  \"Petrocelli\" produced by Leonard Katzman.\n\nAfter two years in  California performing in plays at Company of Angels and doing roles in  episodics and miniseries, Cox moved to New York in the late 1970s. He  has done many theater productions, including Shakespeare plays on  Broadway and in Central Park, and continues to work in television and  film.",

Delate's first professional acting work (and his very special association with the New York Shakespeare Festival) began in 1981, when he was cast in both of the plays performed in Central Park that summer - Henry IV, Part I and The Tempest. Other plays followed (including Joseph Papp's Hamlet with Diane Venora), and in 1984-1985, Delate received critical acclaim for his performance in the award-winning play, Tracers, which had successful runs in both New York (NYSF) and London (Royal Court). An abundance of daytime television and commercial work followed. In 1987, William Friedkin cast him in Python Wolf and not long after, David Jones cast him opposite Robert DeNiro and Ed Harris in Jacknife. Theatre, film and television opportunities all combined to help Delate thrive as an actor. He spent three seasons with the River Arts Repertory, and three seasons with Phoenix Theatre Company doing rotating repertory theatre, along with numerous theatre acting stints in and out of New York. One piece of trivia from that time was that Delate got to play the Humphrey Bogart role of Rick in the only sanctioned stage production of Casablanca permitted by Warner Brothers.  Delate has had the privilege to work with some of the most talented and creative directors and actors in the industry -- most recently in The Brave One (directed by Neil Jordan, with Jodie Foster), in Salome on Broadway, directed by Estelle Parsons and elsewhere and in the film, Salomaybe (both with Al Pacino), as well as in My Brother (directed by Anthony Lover), Buffalo Soldiers (directed by Gregor Jordan, with Ed Harris and Joaquin Phoenix), The Truman Show (directed by Peter Weir, with Jim Carrey and Laura Linney), American Wake and Home Before Dark (both directed by Maureen Foley, the latter with Katherine Ross), Sudden Death (directed by Peter Hyams), Far From Heaven (directed by Todd Haynes), Ash Wednesday (directed by Edward Burns), and The Shawshank Redemption (directed by Frank Darabont, with Tim Robbins).",

  "biography": "A born-and-bred New Yorker, Robert John Burke made his film debut while in his early 20s with a small part in the drama \"The Chosen\" (1981), based on the Chaim Potok story. He went on to study acting at SUNY Purchase where he met aspiring filmmaker Hal Hartley, who cast him as one of the leads in his debut feature \"The Unbelievable Truth,\" an offbeat indie tale where he played a man trying to escape his troubled past. Working with Hartley again on the charming brother-centric dark comedy \"Simple Men,\" Burke caught a major break when Hollywood producers decided that his chiseled jawline was the right one to replace Peter Weller's in the sci-fi/action sequel \"RoboCop 3.\" Despite Burke's efforts, the movie tanked, and he went on to smaller roles in major films, including the lauded Western \"Tombstone\" (1993) and the prison-break movie \"Fled\" (1996). Burke landed his second chance in a Hollywood starring role with the Stephen King adaptation \"Thinner\" (1996), but the macabre tale, which featured him under heavy makeup to depict a callous man who magically loses weight, was deemed almost universally unlikable.Though Burke's leading-man days were mostly behind him, his beastly role in Hartley's \"No Such Thing\" (2001) aside, he soldiered on, and began increasingly working on television with recurring roles on the grim prison drama \"Oz\" and the police procedural \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" (NBC, 1999- ). Appearing in George Clooney's first two movies as director, \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\" (2002) and \"Good Night, and Good Luck.\" (2005), Burke nonetheless became more familiar to TV audiences, particularly when he signed on to play Mickey Gavin, the ex-priest cousin of Denis Leary's lead character on the firefighter series \"Rescue Me,\" a part that dovetailed with Burke's real-life second job as a New York State fireman.Often cast as a tough guy, the ruggedly handsome and tall actor continued to play imposing figures such as Major General James \"Chaos\" Mattis in the Iraq War miniseries \"Generation Kill\" (HBO, 2008) and Bart Bass, the controlling billionaire father of Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) on the soapy drama \"Gossip Girl.\" Before long, he was juggling his ongoing \"Law & Order: SVU\" part with regular spots on the military drama \"Army Wives\" (Lifetime, 2007- ) and the tense crime show \"Person of Interest\" (CBS, 2011- ), while still finding time for supporting turns in films, including the Denzel Washington/Mark Wahlberg action movie \"2 Guns\" (2013).",

  "also_known_as": [],
  "gender": 2,
  "biography": "Offbeat funnyman Martin Mull was born in Chicago, Illinois, the oldest of three children, and raised in Ohio. The blond-maned, blue-eyed comedian with the sad, droopy mustache first came in contact with the arts by honing in on his innate talents as a painter. In order to pay his art school tuition, he started organizing bands. At around the same time, he discovered that stand-up comedy was another way to allow his creative juices to flow. Martin's early recognition as a humorist led to a recording contract, and, over the years, he would be Grammy-nominated several times for a number of eccentric comedy albums. His gimmick and allure came in the form of a dry, humorless delivery and a bland, highly conservative-looking demeanor, which masked a sly, witty and ultra-hip philosophy. Gaining popularity in the 1970s, he finally broke into TV with the cult soap opera parody \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\" (1976) in which he played Garth Gimble, a volatile wife abuser whose comeuppance occurred in the form of an aluminum Christmas tree (impaled) in his home closet. Martin was so popular on the show that he was resurrected in the spin-off series \"Fernwood 2 Night\" (1977) as twin brother Barth Gimble, who was a co-host of the town's television program along with Fred Willard's Jerry Hubbard character. After this peak, Martin became a sought-after guest on the talk show circuit, not to mention variety specials and TV movies. He tried his hand at producing and starring in his own sitcom \"Domestic Life\" (1984) but the series failed. He also added his special brand of merriment to films over the years, some of them being decent, such as FM (1978), Serial (1980), Mr. Mom (1983) and Clue (1985) in the role of the tweedy-looking Colonel Mustard, while most have been either formula schtick or just plain drivel, as in Take This Job and Shove It (1981), Rented Lips (1988), which he produced and wrote, Cutting Class (1989), Far Out Man (1990) with Cheech &amp; Chong, and Mr. Write (1994). Martin's first passion has always been art and the distinguished multi-media artist's work has been showcased in galleries throughout the world. He also authored the book \"Painting, Drawing and World,\" which is a compilation of ten years of his work. Mull is married to a composer and musician, Wendy, and they have a daughter.

  "name": "Jason Gedrick",
  "also_known_as": [
   "Jason Michael Gedroic"
  ],
  "gender": 2,
  "biography": "An American actor best known for his work on the television series Murder One and Boomtown, as well as the motion picture Iron Eagle. Gedrick began his career as an extra in films such as Bad Boys (1983) and Risky Business (1983). After roles in The Heavenly Kid (1985), Iron Eagle (1986), Promised Land (1987) with director Michael Hoffman, Iron Eagle II (1988 in an uncredited role for the first few minutes of the movie), Born on the Fourth of July (1989), Backdraft (1991), and Crossing the Bridge (1992), Gedrick appeared in television series such as Class of '96 (1993) and Sweet Justice (1994). In 1994, Gedrick starred in the film The Force with Yasmine Bleeth and Kim Delaney. Gedrick's big break was in Steven Bochco's innovative 1995 series Murder One. The series followed the trial of Gedrick's character, bad-boy actor Neil Avedon, alleged to have murdered a 15-year-old girl. The series, which also starred talent such as Daniel Benzali, Patricia Clarkson, Mary McCormack, Dylan Baker and Stanley Tucci was a runaway success. Due to this, a second season was commissioned. Due to network concerns, the new season featured several small cases rather than one big one. Anthony LaPaglia stepped in to replace the cast such as Benzali, Tucci and Gedrick, who had left, and the series was canceled midway through its second season. Gedrick's next major project was the three-hour TV movie The Third Twin, a 1997 thriller based on the best-selling 1996 novel by British writer Ken Follett. Gedrick plays a university employee accused of rape, whose friend later discovers he has a twin--and actually several more twins cloned by an evil millionaire university donor and biomedical technology CEO (played to the hilt by Larry Hagman, a.k.a. Dallas's J. R. Ewing). Gedrick next took roles in television series such as EZ Streets (1996), Falcone (2000) and The Beast (2001). None of which were major successes. In 1999, he guest starred on Ally McBeal as the \"hot car wash guy\". Also appearing in Mario Puzo's 1997 mini-series, The Last Don and in its sequel, The Last Don II. Gedrick returned to television screens as Tom Turcotte in 2002's Boomtown. The series, which also starred Donnie Wahlberg and Neal McDonough was a moderate success, but ratings plummeted - particularly after the second season suffered a format change, and Boomtown was cancelled. In 2003, Gedrick played Andrew Luster, the infamous rapist in a Lifetime movie based on his trial, A Date with Darkness. Gedrick is part of the cast of the 2006 NBC television series Windfall also starring Luke Perry and Gedrick's former Boomtown alumni, Lana Parrilla. In 2007 Gedrick again starred alongside Donnie Wahlberg in the A&E original movie Kings of South Beach. He is also the new love interest at Scavo's Pizzeria in Desperate Housewives Season 3 and 4 on ABC.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jason Gedrick, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

In 2010, he joined the cast of Tom Selleck's new CBS police drama Blue Bloods. In the series, he plays Jamieson \"Jamie\" Reagan, a New York Police Department officer and the younger son of the fictional police commissioner, played by Selleck.\n\nEstes' break-out movie role was Seaman Ronald 'Rabbit' Parker on U-571. Early in his career, he did many commercials including Fruit of the Loom and numerous guest starring roles in shows like Highway to Heaven and Santa Barbara. Then he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the series The New Lassie. Since then he has had many starring roles in TV shows and he dabbled in the Music Video industry. He has appeared in Meat Loaf's video \"Objects In The Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer Than They Are\" (from Bat out of Hell II: Back into Hell) and was in Bon Jovi's video \"It's My Life\" with Shiri Appleby.\n\nIn 2000, according to a 2005 Soap Talk interview, Jon Bon Jovi asked him to be in his music video after he worked with him on U-571. He did most of his own stunts in the video. So far, this has been one of his favorite career moments.\n\nWill had a leading role in the Fox show Reunion. The show followed six best friends over the course of 20 years, with each episode marking the next successive year. When the group meets up for their 20th high school reunion, one turns up dead at the end of the night. In late 2005 Fox announced that the series would be cancelled due to low ratings and the identity of the murderer would not be revealed.\n\nAn upcoming project is a short movie Luz Del Mundo. He will be playing Jack Kerouac, a good friend of Neal Cassady. The movie is in post production and will be seen in future film festivals. It was written by Ty Roberts and David Trimble, directed by Ty Roberts and produced by Ryan McWhirter and John Pitts.\n\nHe has also appeared in a couple photographs, in the books Hollywood Splash ISBN 1-57687-183-5 and Men Before 10 AM Too ISBN 1-57687-084-7.\n\nHe was nominated 4 different times for one award, the Young Artist Awards for The New Lassie and Kirk.",
