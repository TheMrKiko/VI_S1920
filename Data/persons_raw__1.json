After Gaffigan\u2019s first appearance on DAVID LETTERMAN, the host personally chose him to develop a sitcom for World Wide Pants. \u00a0Eighteen months later, WELCOME\u2028TO NEW YORK debuted on CBS to critical acclaim. \u00a0He then co-starred with Ellen DeGeneres on her CBS sitcom THE ELLEN SHOW. \u00a0For two years he had\u2028recurring roles both on FOX\u2019s THAT 70'S SHOW and NBC\u2019s ED. \u00a0Jim has also had roles on SEX AND THE CITY, THIRD WATCH and each of the LAW &amp; ORDER\u2028shows, among others. Jim can be seen this November in MY BOYS, TBS' first original scripted comedy series. On film, Jim has endeared himself to audiences by taking on vivid supporting characters in a number of genres. \u00a0In the cult hit SUPER TROOPERS, Gaffigan got huge laughs and famously helped add \"meow\" to the lexicon of Vermont state troopers. \u00a0Jim's quiet dramatic turn in THE GREAT NEW WONDERFUL, a\u2028meditation on the aftermath of 9/11, took audiences and critics by surprise as he embodied an office worker broken by tragedy who ultimately explodes in rage. Gaffigan\u2019s other recent film credits include the forthcoming independent films THE LIVING WAKE and STEPHANIE DALEY. \u00a0He has also been featured in TRUST THE MAN, 13 GOING ON 30, THREE KINGS, FINAL, IGBY GOES DOWN, ENTROPY and THIRTY YEARS TO\u2028LIFE. \u00a0In 2004, he co-starred in TNT\u2019s BAD APPLE, with Chris Noth. Gaffigan recently signed on to co-write and lend his voice to 20 new episodes\u2028of PALE FORCE, a series of animated shorts that will air regularly on CONAN and on the internet via webisodes starting in October. \u00a0The series focuses on\u2028two pale crime-fighting superheroes that, like Gaffigan and O'Brien, are equipped with fair skin. Many recognize Gaffigan from his numerous award-winning commercial campaigns, which include Sierra Mist, ESPN, Saturn and Rolling Rock. \u00a0His commercial\u2028presence earned him Business Week\u2019s 1999 \"Salesman of the Year\"honor.

Following some time in college, he enlisted in the United States Army and served overseas as an infantryman.  Returning to the States, Calderon set his sights on an acting career. Starting out on the New York stage, he won an Obie Award for his performance in Blade to the Heat at the Public Theatre. His most notable Broadway role was opposite Robert De Niro in Cuba and His Teddy Bear. Calderon also appeared off-Broadway in such plays as Requiem For A Heavyweight and Divine Horsemen, and played Achilles in the New York Shakespeare Festival\u2019s production of Troilus and Cressida in Central Park. He is a founding member of the Touchstone Theatre, the American Folk Theatre and the Labyrinth Theatre Company.\n\nCalderon was originally slated to portray the role of Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction; Samuel L. Jackson was subsequently given the role.\n\nCorrection Samuel Jackson told Tarantino he had messed up by not casting him in Reservoir Dogs. Tarantino agreed and told him he was writing a script and had a character that he had written specifically with Jackson in mind. Calderon had a better initial reading than Jackson and Tarantino gave serious consideration to casting him as Jules Winnfield.\n\nCalderon portrays Paul the bartender in dialogue scene between Butch Coolidge and Marsellus Wallace.\n\nCalderon also co-wrote Abel Ferrara's 1992 crime drama Bad Lieutenant, starring Harvey Keitel.\n\nCalderon acted in The Last Castle and the critically acclaimed independent feature Girlfight. His more than three dozen film credits also include Out of Sight, Cop Land, Four Rooms, Pulp Fiction, Bad Lieutenant, The Firm, The Addiction, Q &amp; A, Sea of Love, Clockers and King of New York. In addition, he has made numerous guest appearances on television series, including recurring roles on Dream Street, Law &amp; Order and Miami Vice.\n\nIn 2010, Calderon is set to star as The Businessman in Sanzhar Sultanov's crime drama - The Story.",

After retiring from the sport he took on a number of professions to support his family, before deciding to become a professional actor at the age of 27. With work limited in New Zealand, Dale moved to Australia, where he played Dr. John Forrest in The Young Doctors from 1979 to 1982. He later appeared as Jim Robinson in Neighbours, a part he played for eight years. The character is the role Dale is most associated with in Australia and the United Kingdom. He left the series when he fell out with the producers over the pay he and the rest of the cast received.\n\nAfter leaving Neighbours, Dale became typecast as Robinson in Australia and struggled to find work. His career was revitalised after he relocated to the United States in 2000. Since then he has had roles in many American series including prominent parts in The O.C. (as Caleb Nichol) and Ugly Betty (as Bradford Meade), as well as recurring and guest roles in Lost, 24, NCIS, ER, The West Wing, The X-Files and The Lone Gunmen. Dale has also appeared in minor roles in films such as Star Trek Nemesis, Hollywood Homicide and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as well as the London West End production of Spamalot. Dale has been married to former Miss Australia Tracey Pearson since 1990 and has four children.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Alan Dale, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

After graduating from University of Arizona, Rick moved to Los Angeles to start an acting career. He landed his first role as a security guard in Conspiracy Theory (1997) . He was so nervous he flubbed his two lines. Fortunately, his misread got laughs from Julia Roberts , Richard Donner and the entire crew, and was included in the final cut, giving him some much-needed attention.\n\nAfter other small roles, he had his breakout role as the Freddie Sacker on Darren Star 's Wall Street series The $treet (2000) which allowed him to quit his job waiting tables and move back to New York. He has had several memorable roles on series like Terry Loomis on the critically acclaimed Steven Bochco law drama Philly (2001) . These roles caught Variety magazine's attention who elected Rick one of Variety's 10 Actors to Watch. Then came the role of Jerry Best on The Bernie Mac Show (2001), and Patrick Van Dorn on the John Stamos comedy series Jake in Progress (2005).\n\nHe has had many supporting appearances in movies including The Day After Tomorrow (2004), Blood Work (2002), Hostel (2005), Cellular (2004), and Lions Gate Films The Condemned (2007). He suffered a near-death experience during the filming of the latter in Australia.",

The epitome of the word \"statuesque,\" brunette, big blue-eyed, and 6' tall Lynda Carter was once considered one of the most beautiful women in the western world. Born and raised in Phoenix, AZ, Carter's height caused considerable awkwardness in high school. Friends encouraged her to become a performer; she began studying voice and by the time she graduated, she was named her school's most talented student. She briefly attended Arizona State University, but dropped out to become a professional singer and tour the country with several rock groups. By 1972, Carter had returned home and entered a local beauty pageant. She won and went on to win the title of Miss World-USA. After that, Carter studied acting in New York. She started her career in television making guest appearances on such shows as Starsky and Hutch, but Carter did not become famous until winning the title role of Wonder Woman in 1975. The Wonder Woman shows originally started out as specials on the ABC network, but by 1976 had been turned into a series. The network canceled the show after one season and it was picked up by CBS and aired there for a few years. When the series ended, she had a somewhat successful career as a Las Vegas entertainer. She also continues to occasionally appear in television movies and as a series guest star. ~ Sandra Brennan, Rovi",

In addition, she has won a BAFTA, an Empire Award and a Golden Lion, and has earned a Theater World Award and both a Critics' Circle Theatre Award and a Laurence Olivier Award nomination for her theatrical work.\n\nBorn into a working class home in Ramsgate, Kent, Blethyn pursued an administrative career until her early 30s before enrolling in the Guildford School of Acting after the dissolution of her marriage in 1973.

Having followed her big screen debut with smaller supporting roles in films such as The Witches (1990) and A River Runs Through It (1992), she made her real cinema breakthrough with her role in the 1996 dramedy Secrets &amp; Lies, for which she received rave reviews.\n\nBlethyn has since appeared in an eclectic range of films, including independent comedies such as Saving Grace (2000), Plots with a View (2002) and Clubland (2007), music-themed films like Little Voice (1998) and Beyond the Sea (2004) and big-budget dramas such as Pride &amp; Prejudice (2005) and Atonement (2007).
