He is also recognized for the critically acclaimed film The Namesake. Penn has also taught at the University of Pennsylvania as a visiting lecturer in the Cinema Studies Program.\n\nOn April 8, 2009, it was announced that Penn would join the Obama administration as an Associate Director in the White House Office of Public Engagement. This necessitated that his character Lawrence Kutner be written out of the TV series House. Penn resigned his post as Barack Obama's associate director of public engagement on June 1, 2010, for a brief return to his acting career. He filmed the third installment of the Harold and Kumar series, A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas, then returned to the White House Office of Public Engagement as an Associate Director.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kal Penn, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Intending to study pre-Med in college, she dropped out to pursue a modeling career in Japan. After doing some commercials, she returned to L.A. to made guest star appearances on TV shows and do minor film work. She was Isabella Rosellini's nude body double for Death Becomes Her in 1992, leading her to meet her future husband (Adam Deason) on the film's set. After making a short guest appearance on the NBC show JAG, she wrote a letter to the show's producers expressing her interest in it. In 1996, JAG moved to CBS and she joined the cast as Major Sarah \"Mac\" Mackenzie, sidekick to Lt. Commander Harmon \"Harm\" Rabb (David James Elliott). As a real-life kickboxer and snowboarder, her athletic skills lead the way for physically demanding parts in the action movies Men of War, Crash Dive, and Black Thunder. In 2000 she starred in the sci-fi thriller Thrill Seekers with Casper Van Dien, and in 2003 she briefly moved to comedies for Bruce Almighty. ~ Andrea LeVasseur, Rovi",

He co-starred with Meryl Streep in the Public Theater's 2006 production of Mother Courage and Her Children. He also starred in a short-lived MTV drama series, Dead at 21. In December 2005, he originated the role of Armand in the musical Lestat during its pre-Broadway run at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco, but left the production during its first week of previews (he was replaced by actor Drew Sarich). He is also the only male actor to play Peter Pan in the musical adaptation, though he was only an understudy. He has Scottish ancestry.\n\nNoseworthy made his debut as a nightclub performer in September 2006, at the Metropolitan Room in New York City. His nightclub act, titled \"You Don't Know Jack!\", is directed by Gary Griffin. He is also in a Burbank musical at the Colony Theater called No Way To Treat A Lady written by Douglas J. Cohen. It opened on April 18, 2009.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jack Noseworthy, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He is an actor, known for  West New York (1996), My Own Love Song (2010), and House of Cards  (2014).\n\nHis parents, Lois and Henry Cox, were a teacher and a  Southern Baptist minister, descended from generations of Irish and  Danish farmers.\n\nWhile attending high school in Casa Grande, Arizona, Cox played football and acted in nearly every play the school put on.\n\nAt  University of Arizona in Tucson, he started in pre-med, majoring in  Biology, but he went to see Mourning Becomes Electra at the university  theater, and a week later he changed his major to Theater/Performance  Option. Classical training ensued.\n\nWhile at U of A, he was hired  by Leonard Katzman to play a Comanchero in an episode of \"Gunsmoke\"  being shot at Old Tucson. The SAG card from that made him eligible to  audition for Lee Phillips, who cast him as The Lieutenant in the film  for television of \"The Red Badge of Courage\" with Richard Thomas as The  Youth. That was followed by several guest star roles on the series  \"Petrocelli\" produced by Leonard Katzman.\n\nAfter two years in  California performing in plays at Company of Angels and doing roles in  episodics and miniseries, Cox moved to New York in the late 1970s. He  has done many theater productions, including Shakespeare plays on  Broadway and in Central Park, and continues to work in television and  film.",
