He hosts his own radio talk show, Keepin' It Real, and he makes regular guest appearances cable news television. In 2011, he was named the host of MSNBC's PoliticsNation, a nightly talk show. In 2015, the program was shifted to Sunday mornings.\n\nSharpton's supporters praise \"his ability and willingness to defy the power structure that is seen as the cause of their suffering\" and consider him \"a man who is willing to tell it like it is\". Former Mayor of New York City Ed Koch, a one-time foe, said that Sharpton deserves the respect he enjoys among black Americans: \"He is willing to go to jail for them, and he is there when they need him.\" President Barack Obama said that Sharpton is \"the voice of the voiceless and a champion for the downtrodden.\" A 2013 Zogby Analytics poll found that one quarter of African Americans said that Sharpton speaks for them.\n\nHis critics describe him as \"a political radical who is to blame, in part, for the deterioration of race relations\". Sociologist Orlando Patterson has referred to him as a racial arsonist, while liberal columnist Derrick Z. Jackson has called him the black equivalent of Richard Nixon and Pat Buchanan. Sharpton sees much of the criticism as a sign of his effectiveness. \"In many ways, what they consider criticism is complimenting my job,\" he said. \"An activist's job is to make public civil rights issues until there can be a climate for change.\"\n\n(Wikipedia)",

  "biography": "Jim \u00a0has proven himself a major talent \u00a0beloved to a wide range of audiences after achieving milestones in stand-up, acting and writing. As approachable as he is edgy, JIm is responsible for some of the funniest and most memorable moment in recent television (primetime,\u2028cable and late-night circuit and film. \u2028\u2028As a stand-up comedian, Gaffigan\u2019s clever, quiet style has earned him an unprecedented number of appearances on both CBS\u2019 LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN\u2028and NBC\u2019s LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN. \u00a0His recent one hour Comedy Central Special, CD and DVD, all entitled \u201cBeyond the Pale\u201d have catapulted\u2028Gaffigan to one of the most popular touring and recorded comedians in the country today. \u00a0The DVD for \u201cBeyond the Pale\u201d went Gold within the first six months. After Gaffigan\u2019s first appearance on DAVID LETTERMAN, the host personally chose him to develop a sitcom for World Wide Pants. \u00a0Eighteen months later, WELCOME\u2028TO NEW YORK debuted on CBS to critical acclaim. \u00a0He then co-starred with Ellen DeGeneres on her CBS sitcom THE ELLEN SHOW. \u00a0For two years he had\u2028recurring roles both on FOX\u2019s THAT 70'S SHOW and NBC\u2019s ED. \u00a0Jim has also had roles on SEX AND THE CITY, THIRD WATCH and each of the LAW &amp; ORDER\u2028shows, among others. Jim can be seen this November in MY BOYS, TBS' first original scripted comedy series. On film, Jim has endeared himself to audiences by taking on vivid supporting characters in a number of genres. \u00a0In the cult hit SUPER TROOPERS, Gaffigan got huge laughs and famously helped add \"meow\" to the lexicon of Vermont state troopers. \u00a0Jim's quiet dramatic turn in THE GREAT NEW WONDERFUL, a\u2028meditation on the aftermath of 9/11, took audiences and critics by surprise as he embodied an office worker broken by tragedy who ultimately explodes in rage. Gaffigan\u2019s other recent film credits include the forthcoming independent films THE LIVING WAKE and STEPHANIE DALEY. \u00a0He has also been featured in TRUST THE MAN, 13 GOING ON 30, THREE KINGS, FINAL, IGBY GOES DOWN, ENTROPY and THIRTY YEARS TO\u2028LIFE. \u00a0In 2004, he co-starred in TNT\u2019s BAD APPLE, with Chris Noth. Gaffigan recently signed on to co-write and lend his voice to 20 new episodes\u2028of PALE FORCE, a series of animated shorts that will air regularly on CONAN and on the internet via webisodes starting in October. \u00a0The series focuses on\u2028two pale crime-fighting superheroes that, like Gaffigan and O'Brien, are equipped with fair skin. Many recognize Gaffigan from his numerous award-winning commercial campaigns, which include Sierra Mist, ESPN, Saturn and Rolling Rock. \u00a0His commercial\u2028presence earned him Business Week\u2019s 1999 \"Salesman of the Year\"honor. Gaffigan currently lives in New York with his family.",

Following some time in college, he enlisted in the United States Army and served overseas as an infantryman.  Returning to the States, Calderon set his sights on an acting career. Starting out on the New York stage, he won an Obie Award for his performance in Blade to the Heat at the Public Theatre. His most notable Broadway role was opposite Robert De Niro in Cuba and His Teddy Bear. Calderon also appeared off-Broadway in such plays as Requiem For A Heavyweight and Divine Horsemen, and played Achilles in the New York Shakespeare Festival\u2019s production of Troilus and Cressida in Central Park. He is a founding member of the Touchstone Theatre, the American Folk Theatre and the Labyrinth Theatre Company.\n\nCalderon was originally slated to portray the role of Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction; Samuel L. Jackson was subsequently given the role.\n\nCorrection Samuel Jackson told Tarantino he had messed up by not casting him in Reservoir Dogs. Tarantino agreed and told him he was writing a script and had a character that he had written specifically with Jackson in mind. Calderon had a better initial reading than Jackson and Tarantino gave serious consideration to casting him as Jules Winnfield.\n\nCalderon portrays Paul the bartender in dialogue scene between Butch Coolidge and Marsellus Wallace.\n\nCalderon also co-wrote Abel Ferrara's 1992 crime drama Bad Lieutenant, starring Harvey Keitel.\n\nCalderon acted in The Last Castle and the critically acclaimed independent feature Girlfight. His more than three dozen film credits also include Out of Sight, Cop Land, Four Rooms, Pulp Fiction, Bad Lieutenant, The Firm, The Addiction, Q &amp; A, Sea of Love, Clockers and King of New York. In addition, he has made numerous guest appearances on television series, including recurring roles on Dream Street, Law &amp; Order and Miami Vice.\n\nIn 2010, Calderon is set to star as The Businessman in Sanzhar Sultanov's crime drama - The Story.",

He was so nervous he flubbed his two lines. Fortunately, his misread got laughs from Julia Roberts , Richard Donner and the entire crew, and was included in the final cut, giving him some much-needed attention.\n\nAfter other small roles, he had his breakout role as the Freddie Sacker on Darren Star 's Wall Street series The $treet (2000) which allowed him to quit his job waiting tables and move back to New York. He has had several memorable roles on series like Terry Loomis on the critically acclaimed Steven Bochco law drama Philly (2001) . These roles caught Variety magazine's attention who elected Rick one of Variety's 10 Actors to Watch. Then came the role of Jerry Best on The Bernie Mac Show (2001), and Patrick Van Dorn on the John Stamos comedy series Jake in Progress (2005).\n\nHe has had many supporting appearances in movies including The Day After Tomorrow (2004), Blood Work (2002), Hostel (2005), Cellular (2004), and Lions Gate Films The Condemned (2007).

  "biography": "A born-and-bred New Yorker, Robert John Burke made his film debut while in his early 20s with a small part in the drama \"The Chosen\" (1981), based on the Chaim Potok story. He went on to study acting at SUNY Purchase where he met aspiring filmmaker Hal Hartley, who cast him as one of the leads in his debut feature \"The Unbelievable Truth,\" an offbeat indie tale where he played a man trying to escape his troubled past. Working with Hartley again on the charming brother-centric dark comedy \"Simple Men,\" Burke caught a major break when Hollywood producers decided that his chiseled jawline was the right one to replace Peter Weller's in the sci-fi/action sequel \"RoboCop 3.\" Despite Burke's efforts, the movie tanked, and he went on to smaller roles in major films, including the lauded Western \"Tombstone\" (1993) and the prison-break movie \"Fled\" (1996). Burke landed his second chance in a Hollywood starring role with the Stephen King adaptation \"Thinner\" (1996), but the macabre tale, which featured him under heavy makeup to depict a callous man who magically loses weight, was deemed almost universally unlikable.Though Burke's leading-man days were mostly behind him, his beastly role in Hartley's \"No Such Thing\" (2001) aside, he soldiered on, and began increasingly working on television with recurring roles on the grim prison drama \"Oz\" and the police procedural \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" (NBC, 1999- ). Appearing in George Clooney's first two movies as director, \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\" (2002) and \"Good Night, and Good Luck.\" (2005), Burke nonetheless became more familiar to TV audiences, particularly when he signed on to play Mickey Gavin, the ex-priest cousin of Denis Leary's lead character on the firefighter series \"Rescue Me,\" a part that dovetailed with Burke's real-life second job as a New York State fireman.Often cast as a tough guy, the ruggedly handsome and tall actor continued to play imposing figures such as Major General James \"Chaos\" Mattis in the Iraq War miniseries \"Generation Kill\" (HBO, 2008) and Bart Bass, the controlling billionaire father of Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) on the soapy drama \"Gossip Girl.\" Before long, he was juggling his ongoing \"Law & Order: SVU\" part with regular spots on the military drama \"Army Wives\" (Lifetime, 2007- ) and the tense crime show \"Person of Interest\" (CBS, 2011- ), while still finding time for supporting turns in films, including the Denzel Washington/Mark Wahlberg action movie \"2 Guns\" (2013).",

  "biography": "An American actor best known for his work on the television series Murder One and Boomtown, as well as the motion picture Iron Eagle. Gedrick began his career as an extra in films such as Bad Boys (1983) and Risky Business (1983). After roles in The Heavenly Kid (1985), Iron Eagle (1986), Promised Land (1987) with director Michael Hoffman, Iron Eagle II (1988 in an uncredited role for the first few minutes of the movie), Born on the Fourth of July (1989), Backdraft (1991), and Crossing the Bridge (1992), Gedrick appeared in television series such as Class of '96 (1993) and Sweet Justice (1994). In 1994, Gedrick starred in the film The Force with Yasmine Bleeth and Kim Delaney. Gedrick's big break was in Steven Bochco's innovative 1995 series Murder One. The series followed the trial of Gedrick's character, bad-boy actor Neil Avedon, alleged to have murdered a 15-year-old girl. The series, which also starred talent such as Daniel Benzali, Patricia Clarkson, Mary McCormack, Dylan Baker and Stanley Tucci was a runaway success. Due to this, a second season was commissioned. Due to network concerns, the new season featured several small cases rather than one big one. Anthony LaPaglia stepped in to replace the cast such as Benzali, Tucci and Gedrick, who had left, and the series was canceled midway through its second season. Gedrick's next major project was the three-hour TV movie The Third Twin, a 1997 thriller based on the best-selling 1996 novel by British writer Ken Follett. Gedrick plays a university employee accused of rape, whose friend later discovers he has a twin--and actually several more twins cloned by an evil millionaire university donor and biomedical technology CEO (played to the hilt by Larry Hagman, a.k.a. Dallas's J. R. Ewing). Gedrick next took roles in television series such as EZ Streets (1996), Falcone (2000) and The Beast (2001). None of which were major successes. In 1999, he guest starred on Ally McBeal as the \"hot car wash guy\". Also appearing in Mario Puzo's 1997 mini-series, The Last Don and in its sequel, The Last Don II. Gedrick returned to television screens as Tom Turcotte in 2002's Boomtown. The series, which also starred Donnie Wahlberg and Neal McDonough was a moderate success, but ratings plummeted - particularly after the second season suffered a format change, and Boomtown was cancelled. In 2003, Gedrick played Andrew Luster, the infamous rapist in a Lifetime movie based on his trial, A Date with Darkness. Gedrick is part of the cast of the 2006 NBC television series Windfall also starring Luke Perry and Gedrick's former Boomtown alumni, Lana Parrilla. In 2007 Gedrick again starred alongside Donnie Wahlberg in the A&E original movie Kings of South Beach. He is also the new love interest at Scavo's Pizzeria in Desperate Housewives Season 3 and 4 on ABC.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jason Gedrick, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",
