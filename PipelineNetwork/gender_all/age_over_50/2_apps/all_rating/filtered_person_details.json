His many other stage appearances have included roles in \"Julius Caesar\" and \"Coriolanus\" at Joseph Papp's\u00a0Public Theater, the Broadway production of August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play \"Fences\", and Matt Robison's one-man play \"The Confessions of\u00a0Stepin Fetchit\" at the American Place Theatre. Orman is the recipient of an Audelco Theatre Award and a five-time nominee.\n\nHe made his feature film debut in the title role of\u00a0Universal Studios' 1974 drama,\u00a0Willie Dynamite\u00a0and has also appeared in such films as\u00a0F/X,\u00a0Striking Distance,\u00a0New Jersey Drive,\u00a0Follow That Bird,\u00a0Twilight's Last Gleaming,The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland, and \"Jeremy Fink And The Meaning of Life\". His television credits include work on such shows as\u00a0All My Children,\u00a0Kojak,\u00a0Sanford and Son,\u00a0Cosby,\u00a0Sex and the City,\u00a0The Wire, andLaw &amp; Order. He most recently appeared on episode 5 of the Garry Trudeau/Amazon streaming production\u00a0Alpha House.  In June 2006, Orman's memoir\u00a0Sesame Street Dad: Evolution of An Actor\u00a0was released. In September 2007, his children's book\u00a0Ricky and Mobo\u00a0was released.

In his role as Chief Storyteller, Orman narrates audiobooks and communicates with children, parents and teachers online and at community, literacy and library events, lectures and conferences, and via other media to encourage the use of audiobooks to help build an interest in reading and develop literacy skills. He commented on being Chief Storyteller on October 8, 2008: \u201cWhen\u00a0Sesame Streetbegan, television was a new and even controversial medium. But we showed how that technology, if used correctly, could become a powerful learning tool...I see the same kind of opportunity emerging today as parents and educators increasingly view iPods with skepticism. With AudibleKids.com, I believe we can help turn these players into magnificent storytellers, tools for learning, and a way to promote a lifelong love of stories and language.\u201d\n\nHis new role was announced at a community event at The Educational Alliance Boys &amp; Girls Club in New York City, where Mayor\u00a0Michael Bloomberg\u2019s\u00a0office commended Orman\u2019s life work and willingness to embrace new technology to help encourage children to read books, by naming October 8, 2008 AudibleKids Day in\u00a0New York City. Orman is a resident of\u00a0New Jersey. He has four children, Rasheda, Solana, Miles, and Cheyenne. His son,\u00a0Miles Orman, was on\u00a0Sesame Street\u00a0playing Gordon and Susan's adopted son\u00a0Miles Robinson\u00a0from the mid-1980s into the early 1990s.",

Her recent roles include Lady Adelaide Stitch in the 2005 film Nanny McPhee, Leona Mullen in the 2007 Broadway play Deuce, Madame Arcati in the 2009 Broadway revival of the play Blithe Spirit and Madame Armfeldt in the 2010 Broadway revival of the musical A Little Night Music.\n\nRespected for her versatility, Lansbury has won five Tony Awards, six Golden Globes, an Honorary Academy Award, and has been nominated for numerous other industry awards, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress on three occasions, and eighteen Emmy Awards.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Angela Lansbury, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

Delate's first professional acting work (and his very special association with the New York Shakespeare Festival) began in 1981, when he was cast in both of the plays performed in Central Park that summer - Henry IV, Part I and The Tempest. Other plays followed (including Joseph Papp's Hamlet with Diane Venora), and in 1984-1985, Delate received critical acclaim for his performance in the award-winning play, Tracers, which had successful runs in both New York (NYSF) and London (Royal Court). An abundance of daytime television and commercial work followed. In 1987, William Friedkin cast him in Python Wolf and not long after, David Jones cast him opposite Robert DeNiro and Ed Harris in Jacknife. Theatre, film and television opportunities all combined to help Delate thrive as an actor. He spent three seasons with the River Arts Repertory, and three seasons with Phoenix Theatre Company doing rotating repertory theatre, along with numerous theatre acting stints in and out of New York. One piece of trivia from that time was that Delate got to play the Humphrey Bogart role of Rick in the only sanctioned stage production of Casablanca permitted by Warner Brothers.  Delate has had the privilege to work with some of the most talented and creative directors and actors in the industry -- most recently in The Brave One (directed by Neil Jordan, with Jodie Foster), in Salome on Broadway, directed by Estelle Parsons and elsewhere and in the film, Salomaybe (both with Al Pacino), as well as in My Brother (directed by Anthony Lover), Buffalo Soldiers (directed by Gregor Jordan, with Ed Harris and Joaquin Phoenix), The Truman Show (directed by Peter Weir, with Jim Carrey and Laura Linney), American Wake and Home Before Dark (both directed by Maureen Foley, the latter with Katherine Ross), Sudden Death (directed by Peter Hyams), Far From Heaven (directed by Todd Haynes), Ash Wednesday (directed by Edward Burns), and The Shawshank Redemption (directed by Frank Darabont, with Tim Robbins).",
