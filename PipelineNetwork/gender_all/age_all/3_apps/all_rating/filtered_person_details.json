She made her stage debut in To Kill a Mockingbird when she was 9 years old, and soon after she became a regular on her local stage.

Sagemiller appeared in Movieline magazine in August 2001. In November 2001, Sagemiller appeared in Gear magazine. In early career, she starred on number of teen films, like Get Over It and Sorority Boys, and was lead actress in 2002 box office bomb thriller Soul Survivors.\n\nOn television, Sagemiller portrayed the character Michelle Ernhardt in the TNT series Raising the Bar from 2008 to 2009. After that series was cancelled, Sagemiller joined Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in a recurring role as ADA Gillian Hardwicke. She replaced Paula Patton when Patton departed the series after just one episode. Sagemiller was featured in ten episodes of the 12th season of SVU. She was replaced in the 13th season by Stephanie March and Diane Neal. In 2013, she was cast as female lead on Chicago Fire spinoff Chicago PD,but later left from show.",
