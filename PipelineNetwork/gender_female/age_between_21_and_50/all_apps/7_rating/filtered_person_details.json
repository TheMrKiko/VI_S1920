To date, her highest profile role in film has been as Hannelore in Steven Soderbergh's The Good German (2006), with her character featured on the film's official release one sheet. In 2010, it was announced that Weigert would be joining the cast of the FX drama Sons of Anarchy. She will play the titular motorcycle club's lawyer.",
