  "biography": "Eve Plumb, the actress and painter most famous for playing the role of Jan on\u00a0The Brady Bunch\u00a0(1969), began acting professionally in 1966, appearing in TV commercials. The child actor began getting parts on series television in 1967.\n\nHer place in TV history was cemented when she landed the role of Jan Brady, the middle of three daughters in a mixed family that also featured three sons, in the TV sitcom \"The Brady Bunch\". The show, which debuted in 1969, ran for five seasons, through 1974 and spawned numerous spin-offs. While Plumb declined to reprise the role of Jan in the first spin-off, the TV variety show\u00a0The Brady Bunch Variety Hour (1976-1977) as she did not want to sign a five-year contract (the show was canceled after nine episodes), she did appear as Jan in the subsequent spin-offs featuring the original cast: the TV movie\u00a0The Brady Girls Get Married\u00a0(1981) (1981), the short-lived sitcom The Brady Brides (1981), the TV movie\u00a0A Very Brady Christmas\u00a0(1988), and another short-lived TV series,\u00a0The Bradys\u00a0(1990).  Though she has worked steadily in TV since a child, her only other major role was as a teenage hooker in the 1976 TV movie\u00a0Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway. In the 1990s, Plumb began painting, fashioning for herself a second artistic career. She works out of a studio at her Laguna Beach home. - IMDb Mini Biography",

  "biography": "Lynda Jean Carter (born July 24, 1951) is an American actress and singer, best known for being Miss World USA 1972 and as the star of the 1970s television series The New Original Wonder Woman (1975\u201377) and The New Adventures of Wonder Woman (1977\u201379). The epitome of the word \"statuesque,\" brunette, big blue-eyed, and 6' tall Lynda Carter was once considered one of the most beautiful women in the western world. Born and raised in Phoenix, AZ, Carter's height caused considerable awkwardness in high school. Friends encouraged her to become a performer; she began studying voice and by the time she graduated, she was named her school's most talented student. She briefly attended Arizona State University, but dropped out to become a professional singer and tour the country with several rock groups. By 1972, Carter had returned home and entered a local beauty pageant. She won and went on to win the title of Miss World-USA. After that, Carter studied acting in New York. She started her career in television making guest appearances on such shows as Starsky and Hutch, but Carter did not become famous until winning the title role of Wonder Woman in 1975. The Wonder Woman shows originally started out as specials on the ABC network, but by 1976 had been turned into a series. The network canceled the show after one season and it was picked up by CBS and aired there for a few years. When the series ended, she had a somewhat successful career as a Las Vegas entertainer. She also continues to occasionally appear in television movies and as a series guest star. ~ Sandra Brennan, Rovi",

  "biography": "\"Loverly\" soprano Marni Nixon has ensured herself a proper place in film history although most moviegoers would not recognize her if they passed her on the street. But if you heard her, that might be a horse of a different color. Marni is one of those unsung heroes (or should I say \"much sung\" heroes) whose incredible talents were given short shrift at the time. For those who think film superstars such as Deborah Kerr, Natalie Wood, and Audrey Hepburn possessed not only powerhouse dramatic talents but amazing singing voices as well...think again. Kerr's Anna in The King and I (1956), Natalie's Maria in West Side Story (1961), and Audrey's Eliza in My Fair Lady (1964) were all dubbed by the amazing Marni Nixon, and nowhere in the credits will you find that fact. Born Marni McEathron in Altadena, California, she was a former child actress and soloist with the Roger Wagner Chorale in the beginning. Trained in opera, yet possessing a versatile voice for pop music and easy standards as well, she not only sang for Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg and Igor Stravinsky but also recorded light songs. Marni made her Broadway musical debut in 1954 in a show that lasted two months but nothing came from it. In 1955, the singer contracted to dub Deborah Kerr in The King and I (1956) was killed in a car accident in Europe and a replacement was needed. Marni was hired...and the rest is history. Much impressed, the studios brought her in to \"ghost\" Ms. Kerr's voice once again in the classic tearjerker An Affair to Remember (1957). From there she went on to make Natalie Wood and Audrey Hepburn sound incredibly good with such classic songs as \"Tonight\" and \"Wouldn't It Be Loverly.\"\n\nShe finally appeared on screen in a musical in The Sound of Music (1965) starring Julie Andrews, who physically resembles Marni. The role is a small one, however, and she is only given a couple of solo lines in \"How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?\" as a singing nun. Marni's vocal career in films dissolved by the mid 1960s, but she continued on with concerts and in symphony halls, while billing herself as \"The Voice of Hollywood\" in one-woman cabaret shows. Throughout the years, she has played on the legit stage, including the lead roles in \"The King and I\" and \"The Sound of Music,\" and in her matronly years has been seen as Fraulein Schneider in \"Cabaret,\" and in the musicals \"Follies\" and \"70 Girls 70.\" Her last filmed singing voice was as the grandmother in the animated feature Mulan (1998) in the 1990s. Married three times, twice to musicians; one of her husbands, Ernest Gold, by whom she had three children, was a film composer and is best known for his Academy Award-winning epic Exodus (1960).\n\nMarni Nixon died  July 24, 2016 (age 86), in New York City, New York, USA",
